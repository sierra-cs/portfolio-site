            <h1>About Me 👩🏾‍🦰</h1>
            <p>Howdy, I'm Sierra Stephenson - the creative mind behind SierraCS Studio, where I blend web design, front-end development, and a whole lot of Texas pride into every project I touch. <br><br>I'm an Black American designer and developer born and raised in Henderson, Texas. My love for computers started young, but it really clicked during my senior year of high school when I got the opportunity to work with my school district's tech department. Being hands-on with troubleshooting, problem-solving, and seeing how technology could transform everyday operations? That sealed the deal. I knew this was my path. <br><br>I recently graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The University of Phoenix, where I built a strong foundation in technical skills and creative problem-solving. Now, I'm focused on crafting beautiful, functional websites for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and growing brands - online spaces that are as strategic as they are stylish.<br></p>
            <br>
            <h4>What I Work With 💻</h4>
            <p><strong><em>Skills:</em></strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, iOS Development, UI/UX Design, Design Systems <br><strong><em>Tools:</em></strong> Figma, VS Code, Notion, GitHub, Procreate, Blender, Spline, Xcode <br><br>My experience comes from personal and freelance projects where I prioritize user-centered design and clean, efficient code. I believe the best work happens when creativity and structure meet - and that a little bit of fun always makes the process better.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Beyond the Screen ✨</h4>
            <p>When I'm not designing or coding, you'll find me exploring 3D modeling in Blender, getting lost in a good book, or building elaborate worlds in The Sims 4 and recently inZOI. (Yes, I take my Sims architecture very seriously.)<br><br>I'm passionate about empowering others to bring their ideas to life through thoughtful design, and I'm always learning, always building, always growing.</p>
