# SierraCS Studio Portfolio

A minimalist portfolio website with Mac-inspired elements, showcasing my work as a web designer and front-end developer.

## 🎨 About

SierraCS Studio is my personal portfolio featuring a clean, professional interface with subtle Mac OS design influences. The experience begins with an interactive lock screen, then transitions to a full-screen browsing experience that balances minimalism with thoughtful micro-interactions.

**Live Site:** [sierracs.studio](https://sierracs.studio/)

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Lock Screen**: Welcoming entry point with real-time clock and rotating phrases
- **Dual Navigation System**: 
  - Mac-style menu bar with logo dropdown and system indicators
  - Bottom liquid-swipe navigation dock
- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Rotating tagline that alternates between design and development focus with corresponding visuals
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and animations that enhance user experience without overwhelming
- **Brand-Driven Design**: Custom color palette and typography system (Sora, Jost, Italiana)

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with CSS variables for brand consistency
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Real-time updates and smooth transitions
- **Heroicons & Simple Icons** - Clean, customizable iconography

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> "I got into tech because I saw what was possible — and I stayed because I realized how few people who look like me get to build it. Now I create digital experiences that are intentionally simple but unapologetically bold — because intentional design and code shouldn't whisper when they have something to say."

This portfolio embodies that philosophy: minimalist layouts that let bold colors, expressive fonts, and intentional interactions take center stage.
